/**

Somber is a lightweight declarative and reactive component framework based on [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), created specifically for the [Js13kGames](http://js13kgames.com/) game jam.

The goal of Somber is not to implement everything you could possibly need. After all, [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) already does that.

Instead, Somber aims to implement basic requirements for data binding and reactivity. This allows it to be used when your file size is limited (a la Js13k).

## Use it When

- You want to get something up and running fairly quickly.
- You want a basic structure that is easy to scale and extend.
- Prototyping.
- Game jams.

## Ready to Get Going?

- Read the [getting started guide](getting-started).
- Gain in-depth knowledge from the API docs.

## Support Future Development

Somber.js is made possible by users like you. Through helping find issues, opening pull requests, and [funding continuous development](https://www.patreon.com/straker), Somber.js can continue to provide you with quality improvements and updates.

When you become a Patron, you get access to behind the scenes development logs, the ability to vote on which features to work on next, and early access to development builds.
